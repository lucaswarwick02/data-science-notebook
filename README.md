## Adding packages
You can access the virtual environment by running `.\venv\Scripts\activate` in your terminal.

From there you can run any `pip install <package>`, and then `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to output these to a requirements file

In order to load the requirements into your virtual environment, you can run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then to get out of the virtual environment you can run `deactivate`
